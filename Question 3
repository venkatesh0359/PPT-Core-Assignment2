What is the use of Switch case in Java programming?

The switch statement in Java is a control flow statement that allows you to select one of many code blocks to be executed, based on the value of a variable or an expression. Its primary use is to simplify the writing of multiple if-else statements.

The general syntax of a switch statement is as follows:

switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // Code block to execute if expression matches value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code block to execute if expression matches value2
        break;
    // Additional cases
    default:
        // Code block to execute if expression does not match any case
        break;
}
