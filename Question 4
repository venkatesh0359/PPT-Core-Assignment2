Q) What are the conditional Statements and use of conditional statements in Java?

Conditional statements in Java allow the program to perform different actions based on different conditions. The most common conditional statements are:


If Statement: The if statement allows you to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true. If the condition is false, the block is skipped.

If-else Statement: The if-else statement extends the if statement by providing an alternative block of code to be executed if the condition is false.

Nested if-else Statement: This is a combination of multiple if-else statements. It allows you to check multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code accordingly.

Conditional statements are fundamental in programming as they enable decision-making capabilities, allowing the program to adapt and respond to different scenarios.
