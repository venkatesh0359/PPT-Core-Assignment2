What is Mutable String in Java? Explain with an example.

In Java, strings are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are assigned. However, you can use the StringBuilder or StringBuffer classes to create mutable strings.

StringBuilder: The StringBuilder class is used to create mutable (modifiable) sequences of characters. You can perform various operations such as appending, inserting, or replacing characters in a StringBuilder object.

Here's an example:

StringBuilder mutableString = new StringBuilder("Hello");
mutableString.append(" World");
System.out.println(mutableString); // Outputs: Hello World

In this example, the StringBuilder object allows us to modify the string by appending " World" to it.

StringBuffer: The StringBuffer class is similar to StringBuilder and provides similar functionality. The main difference is that StringBuffer is thread-safe, meaning it can be safely used in multithreaded environments.
