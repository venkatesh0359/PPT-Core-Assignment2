Where exactly is the string constant pool located in the memory?




In Java, the string constant pool is a part of the runtime constant pool, which is a section of the Java Virtual Machine's (JVM) memory. The string constant pool contains a pool of unique string literals.

The exact location of the string constant pool in memory can vary depending on the JVM implementation. However, in general, the string constant pool is stored in the heap memory, which is the area of memory used for dynamic memory allocation.

The string constant pool is a special area within the heap that stores the unique string literals created in a Java program. When a string literal is encountered in the code, the JVM checks if an identical string already exists in the constant pool. If it does, the reference to that string is used; otherwise, a new string is created and added to the constant pool.

By storing strings in a constant pool, Java optimizes memory usage by avoiding duplicate string objects and enables efficient string comparison using reference equality.
