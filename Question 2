Q) What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?

Operators in Java can be classified based on the number of operands they work on:

Unary Operators: These operators work on a single operand. Examples include the unary minus (-) and unary plus (+) operators.

Binary Operators: These operators work on two operands. Examples include arithmetic operators like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

Ternary Operator: There is only one ternary operator in Java, which is the conditional operator (? :). It takes three operands and is used for decision making. It evaluates a condition and returns one of two possible values based on the result of the condition.
