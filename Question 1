Q) What are the Conditional Operators in Java?

In Java, the conditional operators are used to make decisions based on certain conditions. The conditional operators include:

Logical AND (&&): It returns true if both operands are true; otherwise, it returns false.

Logical OR (||): It returns true if either of the operands is true; if both operands are false, it returns false.

Logical NOT (!): It reverses the logical state of the operand. If a condition is true, the ! operator will make it false, and vice versa.

These operators are typically used within conditional statements, such as if statements or loops, to control the flow of the program based on certain conditions.
