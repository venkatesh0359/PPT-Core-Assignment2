How do you compare two strings in Java?

In Java, you can compare two strings using the equals() method or the compareTo() method. Here's how each method works:

equals() method: This method compares the contents of two strings to check if they are equal. It returns a boolean value (true or false) based on the comparison. Here's an example:

String str1 = "Hello";
String str2 = "World";

boolean isEqual = str1.equals(str2);
System.out.println(isEqual); // Outputs: false


compareTo() method: This method compares two strings lexicographically (i.e., based on their dictionary order). It returns an integer value that indicates the relationship between the strings. The value 0 means the strings are equal, a negative value means the first string is lexicographically smaller, and a positive value means the first string is lexicographically larger. Here's an example:

String str1 = "Apple";
String str2 = "Banana";

int comparison = str1.compareTo(str2);
System.out.println(comparison); // Outputs: -1
